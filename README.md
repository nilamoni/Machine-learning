# Machine-learning
A code to predict lattice parameters a, b, c from XRD data for a given space group. For this you will need to download the .cif files from open cristallography database and put it in a folder named training_data. Also put some of the cif files in another folder named testing_data. Place this code together with these two folders in your working directory.
